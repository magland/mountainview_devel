* Download the data
./download_data.sh
This should be around 2-3 GB. Let me know how long it ends up taking.

* clone and compile mountainlab/mountainview
https://github.com/magland/mountainlab/blob/master/README.md
Don't worry about not having MATLAB. We'll get it for you later.
Add mountainlab/mountainview/bin to your path, for convenience

* Fire up the GUI pointing to the downloaded data
mountainview --firings=data/firings.mda --raw=data/pre0.mda --filt=data/pre1b.mda --pre=data/pre2.mda

You should see views that look kind of like the screenshots here:

Click around the GUI.
Use the Actions buttons to open various views
Double click a tab to move it to the other window -- need a better system.
Several of the views are synchronized ... 

Click the "timeseries data" button to open the most impressive widget which displays a huge data file
without loading it into memory and allows very responsive real-time scrolling in/out.
It loads chunks of data from disk as needed.
Use the following controls for this widget:
-- Mousewheel scroll: zoom in, zoom out
-- +/- keys also zoom in, zoom out
-- Click and drag to pan
-- "0" to zoom back to full view
-- Left/right arrow keys scroll left/right by one page
-- Ctrl + left/right arrow keys move cursor left/right
-- Right-click and drag to select a time interval
-- ENTER to zoom in to the selected time interval
-- up/down arrow keys do vertical zoom (on all views together)
-- F (when clicked on a view) flips the channel ordering
